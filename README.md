# PowerDream

Unix-like modular operating system for the Sega Dreamcast. PowerDream uses KallistiOS, a pseudo operating system for the Sega Dreamcast, but it'si not required to be installed as the CMake build system will automatically compile KallistiOS for you. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, near-compatible posix operating system for the Sega Dreamcast with support for 3-D acceleration, networking, keyboard and mouse, VMU's, and anything else that is usable on the Dreamcast. With this operating system, it may be possible to get younger generations to develop games using code and to have them experience the older style of graphics.

## TODO
* Move away from using KallistiOS as this can give us more power and control
* Ramdisk building
* Kernel modules
* Kernel filesystems
